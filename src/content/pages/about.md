## About Me

I'm Mo'men Mahmoud, but most people call me Moe (or **moex0** online). I'm a cybersecurity professional specializing in incident response, digital forensics, CTF creation, and real-world adversary emulation.

My journey into security started from an unexpected place: electronics and communications engineering. While studying circuits and signals, I discovered that understanding how systems work at a fundamental level gave me a unique perspective on how they can be broken. That curiosity helped me discover a talent for connecting dots, which is what DFIR is all about.

What drives me is the belief that I can make a meaningful difference in the world through cybersecurity. Whether that's hunting for adversaries, building detection capabilities, or helping others develop their skills, I want my work to matter. 

I've been fortunate to train professionals at **Black Hat MEA 2024**, one of my proudest achievements so far. I also work on real-world incident response cases.

Beyond security, I'm also a big fan of:
- **Running**, as there's something about a long run that clears the mind and helps me think through complex problems.
- **Reading**, as I'm drawn to books on self-improvement, leadership, and business. Understanding how people think and how organizations work helps me be better at my job (and hopefully a better person).
- **Psychology**, as human behavior fascinates me and helps me understand myself with more depth, be a better person, and work better with others.

## The Purpose of this Blog

I'm a firm believer in sharing knowledge. In our field, hoarding information helps no one. When we share what we learn, we all get better not only at the technical, but also the personal level. That's why I write, teach, contribute, and collaborate on different things. 

This blog is where I document my learning journey and what I think would be valuable to share with others, and showcase my skills. Some posts are technical deep dives, others are lessons learned from my career journey.

**Everything here represents my personal views and experiences. The opinions expressed are my own and don't represent any employer or organization I've worked with.**

## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to connect with fellow security practitioners, learners, or anyone curious about the field. Whether you want to discuss a blog post, collaborate on a project, or just say hello, feel free to reach out through any of the links below.
