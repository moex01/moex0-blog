## Training

### Black Hat MEA 2024 – Threat Hunting Training
**Riyadh, Saudi Arabia • November 2024**

Delivered hands-on training at Black Hat Middle East & Africa, teaching practical threat hunting methodologies to detect advanced threats, including nation-state actors like APT29.

**Topics covered:**
- Threat hunting fundamentals and hypothesis-driven investigations
- Detection engineering and query development
- APT tradecraft analysis and indicator development
- Real-world case studies from incident response engagements

### Platform Training Content

Developed hands-on training content across multiple platforms:

- **TryHackMe:** Defensive security training modules covering SOC operations, incident response, and threat detection
- **CyberDefenders:** APT emulation scenarios and CCD certification content

## Research & Projects

### APT29 End-to-End Adversary Emulation
**May 2024 - Jul 2024**

Full adversary emulation and investigation project simulating **APT29 (SVR)** techniques.

**Infrastructure:**
- Architected a multi-subnet environment with DMZ, IT subnet, and Blue Team stack
- Deployed **Elastic/Splunk SIEM**, **PfSense**, **Velociraptor**, and **Wazuh**

**Emulation:**
- Simulated APT29 attack techniques exploiting **TeamCity CVE-2024-27198** vulnerabilities based on CISA reports
- Conducted post-attack end-to-end investigation

**Output:**
- Created practice scenarios with investigation questions to advance practitioners' skills in threat hunting, forensics, and detection engineering
- Wrote a technical article documenting the methodology of approaching this kind of investigation in the real world

### Ludus Cyber Range
**Feb 2025 - Apr 2025**

Built a scalable home cyber range using **Ludus** (built on Proxmox) to automate full enterprise infrastructure deployment.

**What I built:**
- Leveraged **Ansible** and **Packer** for image automation, host configuration, and tool setup
- Deploy **20-30-machine** enterprise environments within hours instead of weeks
- Integrated security tools: **ELK**, **Splunk**, **Elastic Defend EDR**, and **SCCM** for realistic simulations

**What I use it for:**
- End-to-end attack simulations and investigations
- Testing and validating custom detection rules against real telemetry and attacker behavior
- Strengthening DFIR skills and understanding of attacker mindset through repeated emulation

### CTF Development

Create Capture The Flag challenges to help others learn security concepts through hands-on practice.

## Work With Me

I'm open to opportunities in:

- **Security Training** – Hands-on workshops for security teams on threat hunting, malware analysis, and APT tradecraft
- **DFIR Consulting** – Incident response support, compromise assessments, and forensic investigations
- **Adversary Emulation** – Purple team exercises and attack simulations
- **Content Creation** – Training modules, CTF challenges, and technical write-ups
